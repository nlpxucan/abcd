## News

At present, our core contributors are fully engaged in preparing the WizardLM-7B model trained with full evolved instructions (**approximately 300k**). We apologize for any possible delays in responding to your questions.
If you find that the demo is temporarily unavailable, please be patient and **wait a while**. Our contributors regularly check the demo's status and handle any issues.

- ðŸ”¥ We released **7B** version of **WizardLM** trained with **70k** evolved instructions. Checkout the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12244) and [demo1](https://6f8173a3550ed441ab.gradio.live) , [demo2](https://261f01fdd31bfe1ca0.gradio.live/)
- &#x1F4E3; We are looking for highly motivated students to join us as interns to create more intelligent AI together. Please contact caxu@microsoft.com

Although **on our complexity-balanced test set, WizardLM-7B outperforms ChatGPT in the high-complexity instructions**, it still lags behind ChatGPT on the entire test set, and we also consider WizardLM to still be in a **baby state**. This repository will **continue to improve WizardLM**, train on larger scales, add more training data, and innovate more advanced large-model training methods.

<b>Note for demo usage:</b> Demo 1-4 are all WizardLM-7B. Please use them as evenly as possible to prevent one of them from being too heavy and responding slowly. We only recommend using **English** to experience our model. Support for other languages will be introduced in the future. The demo currently only supports **single-turn** conversation.

## Call for Feedbacks
We welcome everyone to use your professional and difficult instructions to evaluate WizardLM, and show us examples of poor performance and your suggestions in the [issue discussion](https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM/issues) area. We are focusing on improving the Evol-Instruct now and hope to relieve existing weaknesses and issues in the the next version of WizardLM. After that, we will open the code and pipeline of up-to-date Evol-Instruct algorithm and work with you together to improve it.


## Case Show
We just sample some cases to demonstrate the performance of WizardLM and ChatGPT on data of varying difficulty, and the details pls refer [Case Show](https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM/blob/main/src/case_show.md).

## Overview of Evol-Instruct

[Evol-Instruct](https://github.com/nlpxucan/evol-instruct) is a novel method using LLMs instead of humans to automatically mass-produce open-domain instructions of various difficulty levels and skills range, to improve the performance of LLMs.

## Online Demo

We will provide our latest models for you to try for as long as possible. If you find a link is not working, please try another one. At the same time, please try as many **real-world** and **challenging** problems that you encounter in your work and life as possible. We will continue to evolve our models with your feedbacks.

## Training Data

[`alpaca_evol_instruct_70k.json`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/victor123/evol_instruct_70k) contains 70K instruction-following data generated from Evol-Instruct. We used it for fine-tuning the WizardLM model.
This JSON file is a list of dictionaries, each dictionary contains the following fields:

- `instruction`: `str`, describes the task the model should perform. Each of the 70K instructions is unique.
- `output`: `str`, the answer to the instruction as generated by `gpt-3.5-turbo`.



## WizardLM Weights
We release [WizardLM] weights as delta weights to comply with the LLaMA model license.
You can add our delta to the original LLaMA weights to obtain the WizardLM weights. Instructions:
1. Get the original LLaMA weights in the huggingface format by following the instructions [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama).
2. Please download our delta model at the following [link](https://huggingface.co/victor123/WizardLM) 
3. Use the following scripts to get WizardLM weights by applying our delta:
```
python src/weight_diff_wizard.py recover --path_raw <path_to_step_1_dir> --path_diff <path_to_step_2_dir> --path_tuned <path_to_store_recovered_weights>
```

## Fine-tuning

We fine-tune WizardLM using code from [Llama-X](https://github.com/AetherCortex/Llama-X).
We fine-tune LLaMA-7B with the following hyperparameters:

| Hyperparameter | LLaMA-7B |
|----------------|----------|
| Batch size     | 64       |
| Learning rate  | 2e-5     |
| Epochs         | 3        |
| Max length     | 2048     |
| Warmup step    | 2        |
| LR scheduler   | cosine   |

To reproduce our fine-tuning of WizardLM, please follow the following steps:
1. According to the instructions of [Llama-X](https://github.com/AetherCortex/Llama-X), install the environment, download the training code, and deploy.
2. Replace the train.py with the train_freeform.py in our repo(src/train_freeform.py)
3. Execute the following training command:
```bash
deepspeed train_freeform.py \
    --model_name_or_path /path/to/llama-7B/hf \
    --data_path /path/to/alpaca_evol_instruct_70k.json \
    --output_dir /path/to/wizardlm-7B/hf/ft \
    --num_train_epochs 3 \
    --model_max_length 2048 \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 8 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 1 \
    --gradient_accumulation_steps 1 \
    --evaluation_strategy "no" \
    --save_strategy "steps" \
    --save_steps 800 \
    --save_total_limit 3 \
    --learning_rate 2e-5 \
    --warmup_steps 2 \
    --logging_steps 2 \
    --lr_scheduler_type "cosine" \
    --report_to "tensorboard" \
    --gradient_checkpointing True \
    --deepspeed configs/deepspeed_config.json \
    --fp16 True
```

## Inference

We provide the decoding script for WizardLM, which reads a input file and generates corresponding responses for each sample, and finally consolidates them into an output file.

You can specify `base_model`, `input_data_path` and `output_data_path` in src\inference_wizardlm.py to set the decoding model, path of input file and path of output file.
The decoding command:
```
python src\inference_wizardlm.py
```

### Evaluation

To evaluate Wizard, we conduct human evaluation on the inputs from our human instruct evaluation set [`WizardLM_testset.jsonl`](./data/WizardLM_testset.jsonl) . This evaluation set was collected by the authors and covers a diverse list of user-oriented instructions including difficult Coding Generation & Debugging, Math, Reasoning, Complex Formats, Academic Writing, Extensive Disciplines, and so on. We performed a blind pairwise comparison between Wizard and baselines. Specifically, we recruit 10 well-educated annotators to rank the models from 1 to 5 on relevance, knowledgeable, reasoning, calculation and accuracy. 

WizardLM achieved significantly better results than Alpaca and Vicuna-7b.

</p>

In the high-difficulty section of our test set (difficulty level >= 8), WizardLM even outperforms ChatGPT, with a win rate 7.9% larger than Chatgpt (42.9% vs. 35.0%). This indicates that our method can significantly improve the ability of large language models to handle complex instructions.
